## What's pyblish simple?
[pyblish lite](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-lite) & [pyblish-qml](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml) can feel confusing to artists.  
- It shows which validation failed, but not which instance. So you know a vertex is incorrect, but not which one. Good luck finding it.  
- It shows a lot of info. , overwhelming the user. It's not intuitive.  

To solve this, pyblish-simple shows a list of instances.  
When you select an instance, it only shows the valiations that affected that instance.  
This UI is much more intuitive for 3D artists.
- it shows only relevant info for each instance, hiding all other validations. Making the UI less overwhelming
- It's more relatable, because a list of instances is something the 3d artist is used to. It's similar to the outliner in 3ds Max, Maya, Unreal, Unity.

## How to use
- A list of collected instances shows on the left 
- When you select an instance, the validations that ran on this instance show on the right.
- When you select a validation, the validation's description load's on the top right
- color guide for validations & instances
  - 🟢 <span style="color: green;">green</span>: the validation passed 
  - 🟠 <span style="color: orange;">orange</span>: a warning, soft fail, publishing is allowed to continue
  - 🔴 <span style="color: red;">red</span>: an error, hard fail, publishing is not allowed to continue
  - ⚪ <span style="color: white;">white</span>: validation did not run
  - ⚫ <span style="color: grey;">grey</span>: validation is disabled but registered (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) 

## install
- copy paste the pyblish_simple module
- install the dependencies `Qt.py` & `PyQt5_stylesheets`

to launch the UI, run:
```python
import pyblish_simple
pyblish_simple.show()
```

## development
- [ ] improve the stylesheet. current dark mode doesn't look as nice as pyblish lite
- [ ] selected color overwrites the color, which is bad UX, fix this
- [ ] clean up the code. It's in need of some love, since it was quickly put together.

PR-s are welcome.
