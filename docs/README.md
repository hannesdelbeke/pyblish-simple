some bugs kept popping up
due to the way pyblish is written it's not sustainable to maintain this.
and i don't have the time to commit to this. 
i believe a cleaner way is to start over, so will archive this prototype.

# pyblish-simple [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyblish-simple)](https://pypi.org/project/pyblish-simple/)

A  more 'intuitive' Pyblish GUI than [pyblish lite](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-lite) & [pyblish-qml](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml)

to launch the UI, run:
```python
import pyblish_simple
pyblish_simple.show()
```

## How to use
### Users
- Collected instances show on the left 
- Select an instance to show relevant validations in the bottom right
- Select a validation to show it's description in the top right
- right click an instance or plugin to show it's actions in the menu.

colors:
- üü¢ <span style="color: green;">green</span>: the validation passed 
- üü° <span style="color: orange;">yellow</span>: a warning, soft fail, publishing is allowed to continue
- üî¥ <span style="color: red;">red</span>: an error, hard fail, publishing is not allowed to continue
- ‚ö™ <span style="color: white;">white</span>: validation did not run
- ‚ö´ <span style="color: grey;">grey</span>: validation is disabled but registered (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) 

### Devs
- to hook up the `fix all` button: Give your plugins the attribute `fix`.  
Pyblish simple assumes this is a pyblish action & runs it
```python
# code in pyblish simple
if hasattr(plugin, 'fix'):
    pyblish_action = plugin.fix
    pyblish_action.process(self=pyblish_action, context=self.context, plugin=plugin)
```
- avoid context plugins, and use instance plugins instead.

## install
- copy paste the pyblish_simple module
- install the dependencies `Qt.py` & optionally `PyQt5_stylesheets`

## What's pyblish simple & why was it developed? 
The standard UI for Pyblish confused artists:
- it shows which validation failed, but not which instance failed.   
e.g. Pyblish flags that a vertex is incorrect, but not which one. The artist is frustrated, because they don't know which vertex to fix.
- it shows a lot of info, overwhelming non-technical users. Artists don't find it intuitive.  

To solve this, pyblish-simple shows a list of instances.  
When you select an instance, it only shows the valiations that affected that instance.  
This UI is much more intuitive for 3D artists.
- it shows only relevant info for each instance, hiding all other validations. Making the UI less overwhelming
- It's more relatable, because a list of instances is something the 3d artist is used to.  
e.g. a list of meshes in the scene, a list of materials in the scene, the outliner in 3ds Max, Maya, Unreal, Unity, ...

## Limitations
‚ö†Ô∏è It was designed for validating instances, and currently doesn't show context, export or publish plugins.  
Since it's a validator, export and publish are left out.  
Context is left out because it's not something artists should be exposed too, since it's only used in Pyblish (It's programming voodoo).  
You can't touch the context, you can't delete it. So showing it to artists will confuse them.  

## development
- [ ] improve the stylesheet. current dark mode doesn't look as nice as pyblish lite
- [ ] selected color overwrites the color, which is bad UX, fix this
- [ ] clean up the code. It's in need of some love, since it was quickly put together.
- [ ] it was designed for validating instances, and currently assumes a standard collect, validate, export, publish workflow.
  - [ ] research how to show context plugins
  - [ ] research how to show export and publish plugins
