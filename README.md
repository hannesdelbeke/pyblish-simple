a basic pyblish gui

_left pyblish_lite, right pyblish_simple_

pyblish lite can be confusing to artists since it shows a lot of info
it is not always clear which instance failed, and what went wrong.
to solve this, pyblish simple only shows validations from the selected instance.

# install
copy paste the pyblish_simple module, and the dependencies Qt.py & PyQt5_stylesheets in your python environment and run:
```python
import pyblish_simple
pyblish_simple.show()
```
